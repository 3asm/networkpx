iNotifyEx is the successor of GriP that will replace the CFMessagePort-based backend with MIG subsystem for higher performance and robustness. 

(The Objective-C based GriP front-end will still be kept.)

As a redesign, iNotifyEx shall have characteristics of following APIs:
 * Growl-like notifications
 * Android-like notifications
 * Some GriP-specific addition
 * Some iNotifyEx-specific addition

[http://growl.info/documentation/developer/implementing-growl.php?lang=cocoa Growl-like notification API] has the following characteristics:
 * The user has the ultimate decision how the notifications be presented.
 * _Tickets_ (per-app settings) and _priority_ (per-message-group settings).
 * Target-action pattern for server reply.
 * How the notification should be shown is abstracted out as a _theme_.

[http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.html Android-like notification API] has the following characteristics:
 * Actions are sent together with the notification as a _PendingIntent_.
 * Ticker text.
 * The view is customizable via `contentView`, although `setLatestEventInfo` seems more common.

GriP-specific additions are:
 * Suspension behavior, i.e. lock screen mode and game mode.
 * GriP Modal Table View.

iNotify-specific additions currently include:
 * Multiple buttons.
