#summary Guide for localizers on what keys are left untranslated.
#labels Phase-Design

<wiki:toc/>

All projects of networkpx are designed to be localizable, but I don't know all languages in the world, so the translations must be provided by others. Fortunately, there are quite a number of volunteers helping me out on this. However, the projects here are still growing quite fast, and it is easy that new translation cannot be caught up. 

To avoid localizers from having to dig the svn tree every time something changes, I have created this page as a quick reference on what is not translated.

In all networkpx projects, the *English* (en), *Spanish* (es) and *Chinese* (zh_TW and zh_CN) will always be fully translated. The rest are provided by volunteers and the availability will be listed in the tables below.
 * ✓ = Translation available.
 *    = Translation not available.

If you want to fill in the blanks or provide a completely new language, you can simply write a comment in issue 11.

*If you create a strings file, make sure its encoding is UTF-16.*
