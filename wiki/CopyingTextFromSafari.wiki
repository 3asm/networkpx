#summary How to Copy Text from MobileSafari using ℏClipboard.
#labels Phase-Support

Since ℏClipboard is a keyboard extension, the keyboard must show up for ℏClipboard to work. However, most parts of a web page is not designed for text entering, so ℏClipboard can't work. Nevertheless, using the bookmarklets I present here you can either send the whole page to !MobileMail where you can edit, or turn text elements on the web page into a text field by clicking it, and so ℏClipboard can be used. 

= Send Whole Page to Mail =
== Setup ==
 # <a href="http://code.google.com/p/networkpx/wiki/CopyingTextFromSafari#javascript:void(document.location='mailto:?body='+encodeURIComponent(document.body.innerHTML.replace(/\n/g,'')));">Click here</a>
 # Hit the + button on the toolbar and select “Add Bookmark”.
 # Give a name to it and hit Save. 
 # Now, hit the Bookmarks button and click Edit. Find your new bookmark and click on it. 
 # In the URL, remove everything from http:// to # in the beginning. Then hit Save again. 
 # Setup is finished. 

== Usage ==
 # On the page you have things to copy, run the bookmarklet.
 # Now Mail will launch. Locate the text you're interested. 
 # Switch to ℏClipboard and do your copying.
 # Click Cancel to return to the original page. 
Sometimes you'll see no texts when Mail launches. This is simply because the content is not on screen. Scroll down and you'll start to see something. 

= Convert Elements to Text Field =
== Setup ==
 # <a href="http://code.google.com/p/networkpx/wiki/CopyingTextFromSafari#javascript:d=document;l='length';N='tagName';L='toLowerCase';P='parentNode';r='replaceChild';S='stopPropagation';function y(e){this[P][r](this.hh,this);e[S]();}function x(e){s=e.target;if(s[N][L]()in{textarea:0,input:0,select:0})return;if(s!=this&&(s.href||s.onclick||s.onfocus))return;a=d.createElement('textarea');a.value=this.textContent;a.style.width=this.clientWidth+'px';a.style.height=this.clientHeight+'px';a.hh=this;a.readOnly=true;a.onblur=y;this[P][r](a,this);a.focus();e[S]();}c=d.getElementsByTagName('*');for(i=c[l]-1;i>=0;--i)if(c[i][N][L]()in{p:0,blockquote:0,h1:0,h2:0,h3:0,h4:0,h5:0,h6:0,dt:0,dd:0,li:0,th:0,td:0,caption:0,div:0,pre:0,address:0})c[i].addEventListener('click',x,false);">Click here</a>
 # Hit the + button on the toolbar and select “Add Bookmark”.
 # Give a name to it and hit Save. 
 # Now, hit the Bookmarks button and click Edit. Find your new bookmark and click on it. 
 # In the URL, remove everything from http:// to # in the beginning. Then hit Save again. 
 # Setup is finished. 

== Usage ==
 # On the page you have things to copy, run the bookmarklet.
 # Now click on any text you want to copy. It will turn into a textfield and the keyboard will be summoned.
 # Switch to ℏClipboard and do your copying.
 # Click Done above the keyboard and the text will return to normal.
