= I have installed !IntelliScreen and iKeyEx does not work. =
By default !IntelliScreen disabled any !MobileSubstrate extensions. To enable iKeyEx, please go to the Performance option in !IntelliScreen, then enable !PrefHooker-iKeyEx and SBHooker-iKeyEx. 

= How do I uninstall iKeyEx? =
You should be able to find iKeyEx in Cydia -> Manage -> Packages.

If not, try to switch on "Keyboard Extension" in Sections -> Edit.

= How to enable T9 in !MultiTap? =

T9 is a [http://www.google.com/patents?id=PmgCAAAAEBAJ patented] technology and therefore I won't official include it in !MultiTap (unless all software patents are considered invalid). But there's someone else is working on T9. See issue 36 for detail. 

= Is ‚ÑèClipboard compatible with Clippy? =
