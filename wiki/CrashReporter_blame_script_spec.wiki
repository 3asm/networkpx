#summary CrashReporter "Blame Script" Specification

= Overview =

!CrashReporter is an application for users to report crash to developers. By default, it will bring users to the Cydia package or !AppStore description which the user can paste the generated report, which includes the symbolicated crashlog and syslog.

Packages which have dedicated bug tracking mechanism, or have additional info to aid debugging can instruct !CrashReport to include those by "Blame Scripts".

= Format =
Blame Scripts are line separated text files. Each line is an instruction for !CrashReporter. Example:
{{{
include as "iKeyEx Configuration" plist /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/hk.kennytm.iKeyEx3.plist
link as "Report issue" url http://code.google.com/p/networkpx/issues/entry
}}}

Each Cydia package or !AppStore application can provide exactly 1 Blame Script. They should be placed in:
 * `/DEBIAN/crash_reporter` (for Cydia packages)
 * _yourApp.app_`/crash_reporter` (for !AppStore apps)
