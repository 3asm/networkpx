#summary How to use ℏClipboard

= Introduction =

ℏClipboard is a global copy and paste solution for the iPhoneOS 2.2 based on iKeyEx.

= Copying =

== Copying the whole text field ==
When the keyboard appears, switch to ℏClipboard by clicking the International button (the Globe) repeatedly. Then hit the *Copy* button. The entire content of the text field should now appear in the top of the clipboard.

== Copying a portion of text ==
Move the the beginning of the range of text you want to copy. Hit the *Select from here...* button. Then move to the end and hit the *Select to here and copy* button (which is the same button) again. The entry will now appear in the clipboard.

You may use the *Move to beginning* (←) and *Move to end* (→) buttons to aid navigation.

= Pasting =

Just click on any item on the clipboard to paste it.

The item just pasted will move to the top of the clipboard.

= Deleting clipboard item =

Swipe horizontally on any items will reveal a *Delete* button. Hit this button and the item will be gone.

= Templates =

ℏClipboard supports a secondary clipboard called Templates. Hit the *Switch to Templates/Clipboard* button on the lower-left corner to switch between the two.

The main difference between Templates and Clipboard is that Templates can hold infinitely many items, while Clipboard has an upper limit of 10 items. Therefore, Templates is better for storing more permanent texts like user name while Clipboard is better for temporary things like activation code.

= Known Issues =
Some applications use a text field to intercept keyboard input instead of actual displaying. ℏClipboard can never copy on these applications. Examples include:
 * [http://code.google.com/p/mobileterminal/ MobileTerminal]
 * VNC clients, e.g. Jaadu VNC (Jaadu VNC does not even support pasting).
 * "Enhanced" text editors, e.g. !WritePad (!MagicPad, on the other hand, works nicely with ℏClipboard.)
