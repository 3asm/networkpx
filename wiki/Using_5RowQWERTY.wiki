= Introduction =

5 Row QWERTY is a QWERTY keyboard with the row of numbers, just like a standard QWERTY keyboard found in your computer. The symbols are also arranged to look like that of a computer keyboard, instead of the custom arrangement in the iPhone. It also features some commonly used functional keys and a !NumPad.

(Internally, 5 Row QWERTY is a demonstration of the advanced features of layout.plist and how to mix layout.plist with custom layout.)

= Functional keys =

The keys available in 5-Row QWERTY are:
 * ←, ↑, →, ↓: *Directional keys*. Move the cursor left, up, right and downwards. Hold the key to move repeatedly.
 * *Tab*: Inserts a tab (\t) character.
 * *Esc*: Causes the current input field to lose the focus, and usually hides the keyboard as a result.
 * *Del*: also known as *Forward delete*. Remove the character immediately after the cursor. Hold the key to keep deleteing.
 * *Home*, *End*: Move the cursor to the beginning or end of text field.
 * *PgUp*, *PgDn*: Move the cursor one page up or down.

= Known issues =
 * The up, down, page up and page down keys does not work in UIWebView (Safari) (issue 58).
