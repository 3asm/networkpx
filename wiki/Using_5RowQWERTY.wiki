= Introduction =

5 Row QWERTY is a QWERTY keyboard with the row of numbers, just like a standard QWERTY keyboard found in your computer. The symbols are also arranged to look like that of a computer keyboard, instead of the custom arrangement in the iPhone. It also features some commonly used functional keys and a !NumPad.

(Internally, 5 Row QWERTY is a demonstration of the advanced features of layout.plist and how to mix layout.plist with custom layout.)

= Functional keys =

All functional keys are depicted with ISO-9995:7 symbols which are also used in Mac OS X. If you are unfamiliar with the symbols you can tap on it to see the textual description.

The keys available in 5-Row QWERTY are:
 * ←, ↑, →, ↓: *Directional keys*. Move the cursor left, up, right and downwards. Hold the key to move repeatedly.
 * ⇥: *Tab*. Inserts a tab (\t) character.
 * ⎋: *Escape*. Causes the current input field to lose the focus, and usually hides the keyboard as a result.
 * ⌦: *Forward delete*, otherwise known as Delete. Remove the character immediately after the cursor. Hold the key to keep deleteing.
 * ↖, ↘: *Home*, *End*. Move the cursor to the beginning or end of text field.
 * ⇞, ⇟: *Page up*, *Page down*. Move the cursor one page up or down.

= Known issues =
 * The ↑, ↓, ⇞ and ⇟ keys does not work in UIWebView (Safari) (issue 58).
